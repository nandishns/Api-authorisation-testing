```

## Running the Application

To run the Flask application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```

The API will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You can use Swagger UI to interact with the API by navigating to this URL in your web browser.

## API Endpoints

- `/books`: Perform CRUD operations on books.
- `/book/<book_id>`: Retrieve, update, or delete a specific book by ID.
- `/generate_token`: Generate an authentication token.

To interact with most of the endpoints, an authentication token is required. Use the `/generate_token` endpoint to generate a token.

**Note:** Ensure to replace "app.py" with the actual name of your main Python file if it's different. This README assumes the Flask app is contained within a file named `app.py`.
